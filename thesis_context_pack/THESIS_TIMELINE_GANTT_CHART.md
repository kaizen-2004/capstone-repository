## Progress Update (As of March 26, 2026)
- **Current project week:** Week 7 (Calendar Week 13, Mar 23-Mar 29, 2026)
- **Estimated overall completion:** **83%** (implementation-first progress snapshot)
- **Checkbox audit:** Existing checked/unchecked activity states remain consistent with current repository implementation evidence.
- **Legend:** Done = complete, In Progress = partially complete, Not Started = no implementation yet

| # | Activity | Status | Est. % Complete | Progress Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | ~~Flask UI baseline (Dashboard/History/ACK/snapshots) - Laptop~~ | Done | 100% | Core pages and ACK flow are implemented in Flask templates/routes. |
| 2 | ~~Database schema + event/alert engine baseline - Laptop~~ | Done | 100% | SQLite schema and alert/event operations are implemented in `pi/db.py`. |
| 3 | ~~Flask UI baseline (Dashboard/History/ACK/snapshots) - Laptop~~ | Done | 100% | UI routes and pages exist and are integrated. |
| 4 | REST endpoints + security (API key, logging, rate limits) - Server | In Progress | 80% | `POST /api/sensors/event` + API-key guard and logging are operational; rate-limit hardening remains pending. |
| 5 | ~~Vision runtime skeleton (capture loop, frame-skip, queue -> DB) - Laptop~~ | Done | 100% | `pi/vision_runtime.py` capture/process loop writes events and snapshots. |
| 6 | ~~Face detect + LBPH training + "Retrain" UI~~ | Done | 100% | Face capture/training routes, LBPH retraining, and live overlays are operational. |
| 7 | ~~Raspberry Pi primary host setup (Flask/API/DB/alerts + MQTT ingest)~~ | Done | 100% | Raspberry Pi is now the primary host for API, ingest, dashboard, DB, and alerts. |
| 8 | ~~Vision host fallback setup on second-hand laptop (face/fire runtime)~~ | Done | 100% | Laptop fallback mode remains supported for heavier vision loads. |
| 9 | ~~ESP32-C3 MQ-2 Node 1 and 2 firmware + MQTT integration~~ | Done | 100% | Active MQTT smoke firmware is deployed under `firmware/mqtt/`. |
| 10 | ~~Door-force IMU node (GY-LSM6DS3) firmware + MQTT integration to `/api/sensors/event`~~ | Done | 100% | `door_force_mqtt` is active; events are bridged via ingest to the same backend endpoint contract. |
| 11 | ~~ESP32-CAM indoor+outdoor: stream stability + IR baseline validation~~ | Done | 100% | Indoor/outdoor camera nodes are integrated for monitored areas with baseline night operation. |
| 12 | ~~Flame detection baseline (video simulation -> indoor cam)~~ | Done | 100% | Indoor flame detection pipeline is active and fused with smoke events. |
| 13 | ~~Fusion logic (FIRE + INTRUDER scoring windows)~~ | Done | 100% | Fusion windows/cooldowns are implemented in `pi/fusion.py`. |
| 14 | Full system integration + performance tuning (CPU, FPS, ROI) + system enclosure | In Progress | 72% | Integration is operational on the Pi-first topology; performance tuning and enclosure finalization remain. |
| 15 | Remote access (Tailscale) + Telegram notifications (optional shows) | In Progress | 85% | Telegram alert pipeline is implemented; remote-access finalization remains optional/in progress. |
| 16 | Testing and evaluation (module + scenario, metrics, latency) | In Progress | 50% | Metrics and summary export exist; formal repeated scenario runs and statistical treatment are ongoing. |
| 17 | Thesis writing (Ch 1-5, diagrams, results, tables) | In Progress | 65% | Writing is ongoing with implementation context updated; results/discussion sections remain in progress. |
| 18 | Final polish (bugs, UI cleanup, demo script, rehearsal) | Not Started | 0% | Scheduled for later weeks. |
| 19 | Submission + presentation + defense (working prototype) | Not Started | 0% | Scheduled near defense period. |
